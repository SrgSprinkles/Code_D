You need some type of input in order to use php code.

At the beginning of your HTML, before you write your PHP code, do
## form action="learnphp.php" method="post"> ##

Get method appends the data to the end of the URL
Post method sends the data via a separate message instead of inside of the URL.

The general way to write the code is <?php  ...  ?>

echo "string" -  is used to print out something on the screen

$var  -  is used for variables

Concatinate a string, use the . operator ->  'echo "What is " . "up"'

You can type on multiple lines with <<<EOD string or what you want in there EOD;

Constants use the 'define()' function

Arithmetic uses inside parenthesis like (5 + 2)

If you want to set 2 variables equal to each other:
$refToNum = &$randNum;
